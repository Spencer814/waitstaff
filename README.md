Waitstaff Calculator
====================

Tip calculator for waitstaff and customers
------------------------------------------

Forked from a shopping list app built with jQuery, I developed this project with Angular. I learned how to use ngAnimate and ngRoute for simple
animations on route changes.

I also used Bower to install the client side dependencies for this project.

*To Do*
- *use Avalera API to generate local tax info*
- *get user location with geolocation*
- *assign items to separate users for split checks*
